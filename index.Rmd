# Visualizing Violent Crime in Washington, D.C.
## Course: Visual Analytics for Policy and Management

### Maria Zepeda Flores, Quinn Ziegler, and Joshua Jenkins 
<br>

For this project, we are interested in exploring violent crime in Washington, D.C. Crime data on all reported crimes in Washington, D.C. in 2017 were obtained from the Metropolitan Police Department. Data on census tract characteristics, including median household income, unemployment rate, and vacancy rate, were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau 2016 Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. To combine these datasets, census tract characteristics were merged to each reported crime record based on the census tract in which the crime occured.



### Introduction
To begin, we import all of the libraries we will need for this tutorial.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(cluster)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(dotwhisker)
library(ggrepel)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(rmapshaper)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(classInt)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(utils)
```

We then import the data and store it as a data frame. Note that we tell R to import any string fields as character values and not as factors.
```{r}
data_link = "https://github.com/qziegler/visual_analytics_final_project/raw/master/dc_crime_tract_demo.csv"
crimedf <- read.csv(data_link, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Next, we observe the storage type of the variables in our dataset.
```{r}
str(crimedf)
```

Looking at a quick distribution of the census tract characteristics we're interested in, we see that the unemployment rate is in percentage form, but the vacancy rate is in decimal form. To ensure these fields are in the same units, we multiply our vacancy rate variable by 100.
```{r}
summary(crimedf$hh_med_income)

summary(crimedf$unemp_rate)

summary(crimedf$vacancy_rate)
crimedf$vacancy_rate <- crimedf$vacancy_rate*100
```

The dataset we are working with now is a record of every reported crime in Washington, D.C. However, we are interested in what violent crime looks like by census tract. First, we get a data frame that is unique by census tract, including each of the census tract characteristics we are interested in examnining further.
```{r}
aggVars <- c("CENSUS_TRACT", "total_pop", "hh_med_income", "unemp_rate", "vacancy_rate")
aggdf <- crimedf[,aggVars]

aggdf <- unique(aggdf)
aggdf <- aggdf[!is.na(aggdf$CENSUS_TRACT),]
```

We are then interested in preparing a dataset of the violent crime rate in each census tract. We begin by looking at what offense types are present in our data.
```{r}
table(crimedf$OFFENSE, useNA = "always")
```

After determining which offense types constitute violent crime, we create a binary indicator indicating whether each record is a violent crime or not. 
```{r}
violent_crimes <- c("ARSON", "ASSAULT W/DANGEROUS WEAPON", "HOMICIDE", "ROBBERY", "SEX ABUSE")

crimedf$violent_crime <- ifelse(crimedf$OFFENSE %in% violent_crimes, 1, 0)
```

We then aggregate the count (sum) of violent crimes by census tract and conduct a 1:1 merge of this dataset and the dataset with containing tract-level data on household median income, the unemployment rate, and the vacancy rate. As a final step, we construct the violent crime rate for each census tract, which is the number of violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents, and observe our data.
```{r}
census_vc  <- aggregate(violent_crime ~ CENSUS_TRACT, data = crimedf, sum)

census_violent <- merge(aggdf, census_vc, by="CENSUS_TRACT")

census_violent$vcrate <- (census_violent$violent_crime/census_violent$total_pop)*100000
head(census_violent)
```
<br>




### Univariate Plot
Let's start by taking a look at the distribution of violent crime rate among census tracts in Washington, D.C. We see that there are several outliers and one extreme outlier! What is going on here?
```{r}
bp = boxplot(census_violent$vcrate,horizontal = T,ylim=c(0,16000))
```

Here we get a list of the outlier violent crime rates. Most outliers have a violent crime rate between 2,000-3,000, but one has a violent crime rate over 15,000.
```{r}
bp$out
```

We see the extreme outlier is census tract 6202, which represents the National Mall. There are relatively few violent crimes there (only 10), but because very few people live in the area, the violent crime rate explodes.
```{r}
print(census_violent[(census_violent$vcrate > 15000), c("CENSUS_TRACT", "violent_crime", "total_pop", "vcrate")])
```

The National Mall is a unique place in Washington, D.C. and unlike any other census tract so let's exclude it from our data frame of violent crime and define outliers as the other tracts identified from our initial boxplot.
```{r}
census_violent <- census_violent[census_violent$vcrate < 15000,]
outliers <- census_violent$CENSUS_TRACT[census_violent$vcrate %in% bp$out]
outliers
```

However, the initial boxplot could use a little cleaning up. Below, we reproduce our boxplot, but using our new dataset excluding the National Mall. We add the coord_flip() command to flip our plot horiztonally.
```{r}
boxVC = ggplot(census_violent, aes(y=vcrate, z="Test"))

boxVC = boxVC + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
boxVC
```

That's a good start, but let's add a title, a label for the x-axis, and a caption noting the source of our data. Let's also get rid of the y-axis, since it's meaningless, and add some other formatting to make the plot look a bit nicer.
```{r}
box_title = "Washington, DC: In 2017, seven census tracts had an exceptionally high violent crime rate."
box_caption = "Source: Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department \n*The Census tract representing the National Mall is excluded from this plot"

boxVC1 = boxVC + labs(title = box_title,
                      y = "Annual Violent Crime Rate (Crimes per 100,000 residents)",
                      caption = box_caption )

boxVC2 = boxVC1 + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "grey50"),
                        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 9, vjust = -1),
                        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
                        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
                        plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
                        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -1))
boxVC2
```

As a final step, we add a note identifying which tracts make up our group of outliers. We see that there are seven tracts that fall above the distribution given by the boxplot.
```{r}
box_label = "Outliers are Census Tracts 5800, 7406, 7803, \n7804, 8803, 9603, and 10700"
boxVC3 = boxVC2 + annotate("text", x = -0.1, y = 2600,
                           label = box_label, 
                           size = 3) +
                  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())

boxVC3
```
<br>




### Bivariate Plot
Next, let's zoom in on the violent crimes happening in those seven census tract outliers. First, let's create a data frame of all violent crimes occuring in our census tract outlier group.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
outliersdf = crimedf[(crimedf$CENSUS_TRACT) %in% outliers & (crimedf$violent_crime == 1),]
```

We then want to look amongst our outlier group, which crimes are more or less common in which tracts. We start by producing a two-way frequency table by census tract and offense type. We're interested in the relative shares of each crime split by census tract, so we produce a table reporting the shares of each crime broken down by column (in this case, census tract). We then take a look at our table, now saved as a data frame.
```{r}
CrimeType=table(outliersdf$CENSUS_TRACT, outliersdf$OFFENSE) %>%
         prop.table(margin = 2) %>%
         "*"(100) %>%
         round(3)

df.T=as.data.frame(CrimeType)
names(df.T)=c('CensusTract','Offense','Percent')
head(df.T)
```

Let's visualize this table by making a heatmap. 
```{r}
base  = ggplot(df.T, aes(x = CensusTract, y = Offense, fill = Percent))

heat1 = base + geom_tile()
heat1
```

That looks okay, but the blues use a lot of ink. Also, the lighter colors suggest a higher share--perhaps it might be better if this were reversed. Let's change the plot to black representing high shares and white representing low shares and add some formatting for the legend and x-axis.
```{r}
heat2 = heat1 + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "black", name = "Share of Crime \nCommitted in Tract")

heat3 = heat2 + theme_classic()

heat4 = heat3 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.6), 
                      legend.position="right", 
                      legend.direction="vertical",
                      legend.key.width=unit(1, "cm"),
                      legend.key.height=unit(1, "cm"))
heat4
```

Great, now all we need is to add a title, clean up our axis titles, and add some formatting to make our plot look nice. We can see that among tracts with extreme violent crime rates, two tracts in particular account for a large share of homicides, while robberies, for example, are more equally distributed across these tracts.
```{r}
heattitle = "Amongst census tracts with the highest rates of violent crime,\nin which tracts do these crimes most often occur?"
heatsource = "Source: Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department"

heat5 = heat4 + labs(title = heattitle, 
                     y="Type of Violent Crime", 
                     x="Census Tract", 
                     caption= "Source: Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department") 

heat6 = heat5 + theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=11), 
                      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 1), 
                      plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -1),
                      axis.title.y = element_blank(),
                      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 9, vjust = -1),
                      legend.title = element_text(size = 9))

heat6
```

### Map
But where exactly are these outlier tracts geographically? We'll need a map to answer this question. We start by unzipping a shape file from the U.S. Census Bureau giving up a census tract map of Washington, D.C.
```{r}
zipDC = "https://github.com/qziegler/visual_analytics_final_project/raw/master/2017_DCShapeFiles/tl_2017_11_tract.zip"
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
temp=tempfile()
download.file(zipDC, temp)
unzip(temp)
```

We also have a shape file giving us the water in and around Washington, D.C., which will provide as a nice geographic orientation and make our map look a little nicer. Let's unzip the needed files now as well.
```{r}
zipWater = "https://github.com/qziegler/visual_analytics_final_project/raw/master/2017_DCShapeFiles/tl_2017_11001_areawater.zip"
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
temp=tempfile()
download.file(zipWater, temp)
unzip(temp)
```

Let's make sure our shape files are available...
```{r}
(maps=list.files(pattern = 'shp'))
```

...and then import them into R.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
DCtractMap <- readOGR("tl_2017_11_tract.shp", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
DCwaterMap <- readOGR("tl_2017_11001_areawater.shp", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

We take a quick look at what fields are available to us. Let's store the tract field as a numeric in case we want to merge with our other data frames that have this information stored as a numeric field.
```{r}
names(DCtractMap)
DCtractMap$TRACTCE <- as.numeric(DCtractMap$TRACTCE)
```

We're interested in seeing where our outlier tracts are located geographically, so let's create a layer for our map of just our outlier census tracts.
```{r}
tractoutliers <- DCtractMap[DCtractMap$TRACTCE %in% outliers,]
```

Now we can produce our map. We start with a map of all census tracts in Washington, D.C. as our base map.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
base = tm_shape(DCtractMap) + tm_polygons(col = "white")
base
```

Then, we add the layer of only census tract outliers on top, coloring them black so they stand out but also minimizing the ink we use. Next, we add our water later for aesthetics.
```{r}
layer1 = base +  tm_shape(tractoutliers) + tm_polygons(col = "black")

layer2 = layer1 + tm_shape(DCwaterMap) + tm_polygons(col="steelblue")
layer2
```

Finally, let's add a compass and scale bar, as well as title of what the map shows. We'll also add some formatting to the title and map to make sure everything fits nicely.
```{r}
fullMap = layer2 + tm_compass(position = c('left','TOP'),type = 'arrow') +
                   tm_scale_bar(position=c("left", "BOTTOM"),width = 0.2)

maptitle = "Washington, D.C. 2017: Census Tracts with Violent \nCrime Rates > 2,000 per 100,000 Residents"

fullMap = fullMap +  tm_layout(main.title = maptitle,
                     main.title.position = 'left',
                     main.title.size = 1,
                     main.title.fontface = "bold",
                     inner.margins=c(0.01,0.3,0.01,0.01)) 


fullMap
```
<br>




### Multivariate Plots
To get a sense of what may be driving violent crime, we begin by preparing a correlation plot between our variables of interest. To make the data names appear nicer for our plot, we clean them up here and create a copy of our tract-level data frame with these new names.
```{r}
col_names <- c("Census.Tract", 
               "Total.Population", 
               "Median.Household.Income",
               "Unemployment.Rate",
               "Vacancy.Rate",
               "Violent.Crime.Count",
               "Violent.Crime.Rate")

corrdf <- census_violent
colnames(corrdf) <- col_names
```

With this cleaned-up data frame, we then prepare our correlation plot in earnest. We tell R to remove column 1 (Census Tract) and column 6 (Violent Crime Count) from our correlation plot, and that red should represent low values (i.e., negative correlations) and blue should represent high values (i.e., positive correlations).
```{r}
corrp = ggcorr(corrdf[,-c(1,6)],
                 hjust = 0.9,
                 size=3,
                 layout.exp=1,
                 low = 'red',high = 'blue')
corrp
```

That looks pretty good. All we need is a title for our legend, a title for our plot, the data source, and a bit of formatting. From this plot, we see which variables are positively or negatively correlated with the violent crime rate (as well as each other) and the strength of these relationships. Median household income appears moderately negatively correlated with the violent crime rate, whereas unemployment rate and vacancy rate have a perhaps moderately positive relationship with the violent crime rate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, median household income and the unemployment rate have a very strong negative relationship with one another.
```{r}
corrp2 = corrp + guides(fill = guide_legend("Correlation:"))

title = "Washington, DC: Census tract median household income and population is strongly \nand negatively correlated with the violent crime rate."
caption = "Source: Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates"

corrp3 = corrp2 + labs(title = title,
                       caption = caption)

corrp4 = corrp3 + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold", hjust = 0),
                        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),
                        legend.position = "right")

corrp4
```


But how similar are census tracts to one another based on these characteristics, especially with respect to the outliers we identified in the box plot above? To do this we begin by clustering the census tracts based on the characteristics in our correlation plot. Again, we tell R to ignore the tract number column and violent crime count column.
```{r}
set.seed(228715)

corrdf_comp <- corrdf[complete.cases(corrdf),]
result <- kmeans(corrdf_comp[,-c(1,6)], centers = 3)
corrdf_comp$Cluster <- result$cluster
```

We then calculate the Euclidean-distance among census tracts, based on these tract-level characteristics, using a multi-dimensional scaling approach. In this case, we tell R to ignore the violent crime count column and the new column we just added representing the tract cluster. Our resulting data frame provides an x and y coordinate for each census tract based on its relative distance to all other census tracts in our dataset. 
```{r}
tmpdf <- corrdf_comp[,-c(6,9)]
distanceAmong <- dist(tmpdf[,-1])
result <- cmdscale(distanceAmong, eig = TRUE, k = 2)

dim1 <- result$points[,1]
dim2 <- result$points[,2]

coordinates <- data.frame(dim1, dim2, 
                          census_tract = corrdf_comp$Census.Tract, 
                          cluster = corrdf_comp$Cluster,
                          vc_rate = corrdf_comp$Violent.Crime.Rate)
```


To visualize how similar or different these census tracts are, we then plot their calculated coordinates and color their position by which cluster they belong to. We also label each of our outliers to see how similar or different they are from census tracts with violent crime rates that are not as extreme. From our plot, we see that our outliers (tracts with exceptionally high violent crime rates) are generally similar to other tracts in the Washington, D.C.
```{r}
base = ggplot(coordinates, aes(x = dim1, y = dim2, color = factor(cluster))) +
          scale_color_manual(values = c("deepskyblue3","grey30","darkorange3"), 
                             name = "Census Tract Cluster")
  
clust1 = base + geom_point() + geom_text_repel(aes(label=ifelse(census_tract %in% outliers,
                                                                census_tract,"")), 
                                               size = 4, show.legend = FALSE)
clust1
```

As a final step, let's add our titles and formatting as usual, but let's also get rid of the x and y-axes. The plot represents the relative distance of points to one another, but the specific coordinate values themselves offer no meanngful information.
```{r}
title = "Washington, DC: Census tracts with exceptionally high violent crime rates are not that \ndifferent from other tracts based on income, employment, and unit vacancy"
caption = "Source: Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates"

clust2 = clust1 + labs(title = title,
                       caption = caption)

clust3 = clust2 + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "grey50"),
                        axis.title = element_blank(),
                        axis.text = element_blank(),
                        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
                        plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
                        legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
                        legend.position = "bottom",
                        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))

clust3
```




But we're still curious as to what tract-level characteristics, if any, may be a good predictor of violent crime. To do this we want to perform a regression analysis. We're interested in comparing coefficient estimates and making interpretation of these estimates a bit easier, so we log-transform each variable in our simple model. However, to ensure that our data doesn't give us any issues when trying to run our analysis, we create a copy of our data frame, drop any tracts with missing data, and replace any values equal to 0 to now be equal to 0.01 to allow for the log transformation.
```{r}
regdf <- census_violent[complete.cases(census_violent),]
regdf <- apply(regdf, 2, function(x) ifelse(x==0,0.01,x))
regdf <- as.data.frame(regdf)
```

We then estimate a regression model predicting the tract violent crime rate based on the tract total population, household median income, and vacancy rate and output a summary of our results.
```{r}
modelA <- lm(log(vcrate) ~ log(total_pop) + log(hh_med_income) + log(vacancy_rate), 
              data = regdf)

summary(modelA)
```

We store these results in a table for our use later and create a field called naming the model that was just estimated.
```{r}
modelA_t <- tidy(modelA) %>% mutate(model = "No Employment Control")
```

We then prepare a second regression model, this time adding a control for the unemployment rate, and output a summary of these results.  
```{r}
modelB <- lm(log(vcrate) ~ log(total_pop) + log(hh_med_income) + log(unemp_rate) + log(vacancy_rate), 
              data = regdf)

summary(modelB)
```

Again, we store these results in a table, but this time, append it to the table with the model results from our model without the unemployment rate control.
```{r}
modelB_t <- tidy(modelB) %>% mutate(model = "Employment Control")
allmodels <- rbind(modelB_t, modelA_t)
```

We'd like to see how the addition of the unemployment rate control affected the coefficient estimates on the other variables in the model. Let's start by creating a plot of the coefficient estimates and the 95% confidence intervals around each estimate. We'll add a dashed line at zero to indicate which coefficient estimates include zero within the confidence interval (implying the estimated effect is not statistically significant).
```{r}
plot1 = dwplot(allmodels) + 
            geom_vline(xintercept = 0, 
               colour = "grey60", 
               linetype = 2) +
            scale_colour_grey(start = .1, end = .5, name="Model") + theme_bw()
plot1
```

Let's add our titles and source, as usual.
```{r}
title = "Controlling for unemployment rate substantially reduces the magnitude \nof the negative effect of household income on the violent crime rate."
caption = "Source: Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, \n2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates"

plot2 = plot1 + labs(title = title,
                     x = "% Change in Violent Crime Rate",
                     y = "Census Tract Characteristic",
                     caption = caption)
plot2
```


We see we still need to clean this plot up a bit. Let's start by specifying what we want on our axes and then adding our normal formatting. We see that without controlling for the unemployment rate, household median income was the lone strong predictor of violent crime in our model. However, by controlling for unemployment rate, we see that the effect of median household income is effectively eliminated and that the unemployment rate becomes a strong predictor of violent crime. This is consistent with what we saw in the correlation plot, where household median income and the unemployment rate were strongly correlated. This could suggest that unemployment rate is perhaps a strong driver of violent crime and the effect of household median income by itself is largely driven by the level of unemployment in the tract.
```{r}
plot3 = plot2 + scale_y_discrete(labels = c("Vacancy Rate",
                                            "Unemployment Rate",
                                            "Median Household Income",
                                            "Total Population")) +
                scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2,-1,0,1,2), limits = c(-2,2))

plot4 = plot3 + theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
                      plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
